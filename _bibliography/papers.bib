abstract="In low resource contexts, access to technologies is limited. Most firms in developing countries are still using analog technologies and have not attained the industrial maturity required to harness the benefits of industry 4.0, which include increased productivity and a reduced environmental impact of the manufacturing sector. This further exacerbates the unequal wealth distribution pervasive in today's globalized world. With the democratization of the internet and increasing accessibility to microcontrollers and automation technology, the last decade has seen the rise of open source machine tools (OSMT) such as CNC mills and 3D printers. By facilitating sustainable and inclusive production capacity building, OSMT are a key technology driver that can enable developing countries to leapfrog their industries. However, their potential for cost effective and low-threshold production capacity building in developing countries has been hitherto underexplored. This paper reports the findings of a pilot study in Oman with ten migrant-run microenterprises in the carpentry and steel fabrication industries. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. The study identifies and discusses the challenges that could hinder the implementation of OSMT in a resource constrained context, which include insufficient technological and digital literacy, a lack of formal education, and risk adversity. Based on this, the paper proposes solutions to foster OSMT adoption.",
