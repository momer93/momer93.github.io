abstract="In low resource contexts, access to technologies is limited. Most firms in developing countries are still using analog technologies and have not attained the industrial maturity required to harness the benefits of industry 4.0, which include increased productivity and a reduced environmental impact of the manufacturing sector. This further exacerbates the unequal wealth distribution pervasive in today's globalized world. With the democratization of the internet and increasing accessibility to microcontrollers and automation technology, the last decade has seen the rise of open source machine tools (OSMT) such as CNC mills and 3D printers. By facilitating sustainable and inclusive production capacity building, OSMT are a key technology driver that can enable developing countries to leapfrog their industries. However, their potential for cost effective and low-threshold production capacity building in developing countries has been hitherto underexplored. This paper reports the findings of a pilot study in Oman with ten migrant-run microenterprises in the carpentry and steel fabrication industries. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. The study identifies and discusses the challenges that could hinder the implementation of OSMT in a resource constrained context, which include insufficient technological and digital literacy, a lack of formal education, and risk adversity. Based on this, the paper proposes solutions to foster OSMT adoption.",

  abstract="Similar to open source software, the open source hardware (OSHW) movement is seen as a technology driver which can enable developing economies to leapfrog their industries. While machine tools are a subset of OSHW, they have received relatively little academic attention compared to electronic OSHW. This study applies an explorative research approach and analyses open source designs for machine tools freely available on the internet. By coining, the term open source machine tools (OSMT), it determines their applicability in low resource contexts and identifies the potential of OSMTs in democratizing manufacturing technologies. OSMTs thereby encourage diversification, entrepreneurship, and inclusive industrial development, thus contributing to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal no. 8 which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Specific areas for OSMT application in low-resource contexts and factors and barriers affecting their success are singled out."

  abstract="he democratization of desktop 3D printing has opened the domain of manufacturing to the masses. Today individuals can design and manufacture a variety of products in their living rooms. However, scaling a product from prototype to production and setting up a small-scale manufacturing business is often hindered by the expensive machinery and high upfront capital investment required. This paper presents the findings of a unique experiment that was carried out to understand the process of prototyping a relatively complex product (in this case, a 3D printer) in a home setting and then scaling it up to a small-scale production (10 units). In order to partially automate the manufacturing processes, two open source machine tools (OSMT), whose blueprints are freely available in the internet, were built, namely a CNC laser cutter and a CNC milling machine. The experiment reveals the particularities of starting a small-scale production in a home setting and the potential of OSMT to affordably scale up production, while also highlighting the challenges of OSMT adoption."
