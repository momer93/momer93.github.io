The aim of this experimental work was to determine the formability of steel sheet under hot forming with porous media. The procedure consisted of heating a flat steel sheet rapidly with an inductive heating coil, and when the temperature reached 900 degree Celsius, the sheet was hot stamped between two dies. Counter pressure was applied within the bottom die by sand. The stamping process was carried out on a Zwick tensile testing machine. The top stamping piston was in direct contact with the workpiece, while the bottom of the workpiece was compressed into a die with sand in it.
