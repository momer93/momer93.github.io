A GCODE Generator GUI was created using python that could generate gcodes for specific shapes like a square, circle, triangle and a stiffener plate along with nesting the shapes for optimum space utilization. The GUI was created as a response to feedback recieved from the first user testing of the open source CNC gas cutter with the microenterprise end users. The users could not read or understand english and did not have any CAD or CAM knowledge. Therefore, a first simple user interface was required that would allow the users to skip the complex CAD and CAM processes for the most commonly cut shapes in the shop.

The end user is asked to input the dimensions of the shape they want to cut and the thickness of the material. Next they have to enter the size of the sheet and the number of parts they would like to cut out from it. The system automatically nests the parts in the best possible configuration.
