The shell eco marathon was the first long term project that I worked on during my bachelors in 2014 and 2015. The aim of the project was to design and build a fuel efficient vehicle whose ultimate aim was to minimize fuel consumption. As team leader and project manager, not only was I responsible for the technical execution of the project but also the overall project management. Through the project I learnt what it mean't to work with team members of different backgrounds, skills and motivations and to deliver a project on time. I was responsible for the design of the chassis, drivetrain, wheels, braking system and all manufacturing.

## Chassis

For our first competition I designed a welded aluminium hollow section chassis. Considering the low speeds of the vehicle and resulting low dynamic loads, the design focus in terms of the chassis was primarily to have a chassis that was resistant to static bending loads (due to weight) and dynamic twisting loads due to corners and braking. The profiles chosen were rectangular hollow aluminium profiles, primarily due to their high moment of inertia in bending plane along with aluminium's high strength to weight ratio which made it an optimum choice for large frames. The flat faces of the hollow profile compared to a circular section also made it easy to mount the other components onto the chassis.


With our constant drive to achieve a lightweight design, for the second year I designed a fully carbon fibre monocoque chassis. Here

## Project Management

Use of excel ghannt charts and work packages to do the long term project managemt and trello to carry out the daily project management in an agile manner.
