A GCODE Generator GUI was created using python that could generate gcodes for specific shapes like a square, circle, triangle and a stiffener along with nesting the shapes for optimum space utilization. This GUI was created as a response to feedback recieved from the first user testing of the open source CNC gas cutter with the microenterprise end users. The users could not read or understand english and did not have any CAD or CAM knowledge. Therefore a simple user interface was required that would allow the users to skip the complex CAD and CAM processes for the most commonly cut shapes in the shop.
