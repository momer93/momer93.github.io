## Overview

A low-cost, large-format CNC router designed for microenterprises in resource-constrained environments.  
The goal: enable small workshops to mill **full-sized sheets** (2.4 m × 1.2 m) of wood, plastics, and composite materials such as dibond—materials commonly used in signboard fabrication.

Most commercially available CNC routers that handle full sheets are:

- Too expensive  
- Too bulky and heavy  
- Not locally available  
- Overengineered for the needs of small workshops  

This project explores how a **frugal, locally fabricable, stowable CNC router** can extend the capabilities of small workshops and help them capture more value in their production chains.

## Problem & Context

The collaborating microenterprise specialized in fabricating **steel frames for signboards**.  
However, this activity lies at the *bottom* of the value chain—easy to do, widely offered, heavily price-pressured, and minimally profitable.

The higher-value steps—such as:

- Cutting complex letters  
- Shaping dibond panels (arrows, ovals, logos)  
- Engraving signboard faceplates  

…were out of reach because they require **CNC routing**.

### Local challenges observed:

- Cutting complex shapes by hand leads to **poor aesthetic quality**, customer complaints, and reduced competitiveness.  
- Dibond and plastics are difficult to mark and cut manually in precise shapes.  
- No local manufacturer produces CNC routers; imports from China are prohibitively expensive.  
- Imported machines are large, rigid, and **too bulky** for 15–20 m² workshops.  
- Microenterprises need something **portable, affordable, and stowable**—not a heavy industrial machine.

A frugal CNC router would allow these workshops to:

- Produce letters, icons, and decorative elements in-house  
- Capture more of the value chain  
- Offer services previously outsourced or unavailable  
- Improve quality and consistency for customers

## Design Goals

Drawing from interviews and fieldwork, the design was guided by:

- **Affordability:** cost appropriate for microenterprises  
- **Use of local materials:** steel profiles, standard bearings, accessible hardware  
- **Compactness:** ability to fold, disassemble, or stow when not in use  
- **Ease of replication:** compatible with local fabrication capabilities  
- **Reliability & robustness:** able to handle heavy daily use in dusty, open-air workshops  
- **Minimalism:** avoid unnecessary complexity; focus on essential functions only  

The overarching design question was:

> “What is the simplest possible CNC router that can mill full sheets while being realistic to build in a microenterprise?”

## Design Approach

The CNC router builds on lessons learned from the **Frugal CNC Oxyfuel Cutter** (link to be inserted):

- Same **steel-frame architecture**  
- Similar **roller-bearing linear motion system**  
- A modular, frugal mechanical design suitable for manual fabrication  
- A layout that can be assembled using paper templates, tape measures, and drill presses  

This continuity allowed rapid prototyping, reuse of proven subsystems, and a reduction in design risk.

### Key adaptations for routing:

Routing imposes different physical demands than oxyfuel cutting. Routing requires:

- Higher stiffness  
- Controlled Z-axis movement over a wider range  
- Chip evacuation considerations  
- More precise positional tolerances

The frugal router design therefore incorporates:

- Reinforced steel-frame geometry  
- Adapted linear carriages to handle lateral cutting forces  
- Mounting structures for a commonly available trim router/spindle  
- Simplified mechanisms that balance precision with manufacturability  

All components were selected or redesigned so they could be sourced locally or fabricated in the workshop.

## Why a Frugal Router Matters

For microenterprises in this context, a CNC router is not merely a tool—it is a **gateway to better economic positioning**:

- Moves the enterprise up the value chain  
- Enables entry into the high-margin signboard fabrication market  
- Improves quality, consistency, and turnaround time  
- Expands capabilities into furniture, cabinetry, engraving, prototyping, and more  

An accessible CNC router can transform the workshop from a subcontractor of low-value tasks into a more autonomous, competitive production unit.

## Current Status

A functional frugal CNC router design has been developed based on the architecture of the oxyfuel cutter, with adaptations for routing forces, sheet handling, and workshop constraints.

Further prototyping, testing, and validation are ongoing. More detailed performance data and design analysis will be released following associated publications.
