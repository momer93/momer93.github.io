## Project Overview

This project presents a low-cost CNC oxyfuel cutter designed specifically for metal fabrication microenterprises in Oman. These small workshops often build structural and non-structural items such as gates, staircases, warehouses, and furniture — all requiring the cutting of thick steel plates (3–50+ mm).

Despite the efficiency of automated cutting, CNC machines remain inaccessible to these workshops due to high cost, limited space, and lack of local availability.

## Understanding User Needs

A field study was conducted in the industrial cluster of Wadi Kabir Sanaya, Muscat. Most workshops are open-air, compact (15–20 m²), and operated by 2–3 migrant workers from South Asia. Key insights from interviews and observations include:

- No existing use of CNC or digital fabrication tools
- Frequent use of handheld oxyfuel torches
- Cutting done on full or scrap sheets, often outside due to their weight
- Strong preference for compact, affordable, and stowable machines
- Limited access to electronics or precision components locally

## Design Decisions

### Why Oxyfuel Cutting?

Among various fabrication processes, gas cutting was selected for automation due to:

- High repetition of cutting tasks
- Time-consuming and hazardous manual cutting
- Poor cut quality requiring extensive post-processing

### Frugal, Participatory Design

The machine was designed **with** end users using a co-design approach whereby the prototype was fabricated within one of the workshops. Workers participated in:

- Suggesting fabrication methods
- Design improvements
- Solving design challenges during assembly for example by co-designing by prptotyping some of the complex sub-assemblies like the Z-axis
- Assembling the machine frame in the workshop

### Local Constraints and Adaptations

- The machine was built from easily available surplus workshop materials (e.g., 2” square steel tubing)
- Simple linear guides using locally available roller bearings
- No reliance on imported machine torches — compatible with users’ own handheld torches
- Fabrication aided by paper templates for marking and drillingpp

- Materials like aluminum and precision linear rails were unavailable or too expensive
- No access to standard machine parts (e.g., M3 screws), so designs were adapted
- CAD development followed field sketches and rough calculations

## Key Features

- **Affordable**: Target price $500–800 (small shops), up to $3000 (larger shops)
- **Compact**: Easily stowable when not in use
- **Safe & Efficient**: Reduces risk, labor, and post-processing
- **User-Centric**: Designed and built with the microenterprise workers taking local materials and capabilities into account
