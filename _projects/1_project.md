An automated oxyfuel cutter was designed for a migrant run steel fabrication microenterprise in Oman. The aim of the design is to automate the hand held oxyfuel cutter as seen in figure below. The machine was designed to be as affordable as possible while being reliable enough to function in the harsh environments seen in Oman. The design is focused on being ultra affordable while being able to be built from the local resouces available to the microenterprises. Therefore this isn't a design for everyone but really tailored to be reproduced in Oman with simple tools and components. The machine frame is made from standard square steel profiles which are locally available. The Motors, belt drive components and electronics are typical 3d printer components and were chosen due to their affordability and availability.

The project was started by carrying our a field visit to manufacturing microenterprises in the industrial cluster of Wadi Kabir Sanaya in the city of Muscat. The cluster has a pre-dominantly dense population of migrant run manufacturing microenterprises. Due to limited online and telecommunication opportunities of the microenterprises, interviews with the respondents were carried out face to face at their sites of business. The respondents were all male migrants from the South Asian countries of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. Talking with the shop owners revealed insights into their available resources, educational backgrounds and day to day lives. Most had small workshop spaces which were not more than 15-20 square meters. They were all open air workshops with no climate control and dust being everywhere. When asked about the need for more automated machines, they often complained about the lack of space because they imagined CNC or automated machine tools must be really big as industrial machines normally are. Most small shops had 2-3 workers and none of the workshops observed had any CNC machine tools. Those that did possess machine tools, these were usually manual lathes that were often purchased used. None of them carried out precision work, so they usually produced structural (car park shades, warehouses etc) and non structural items (gates, staircases, railings, furniture etc.) None of them had access to CNC machine tools and had no idea about CAD or CAM. As a next step various manufacturing processes within such workshops were observed to determine possible processes that could be automated. Gas cutting was chosen due to its potential for increased efficiency and productivity for the users.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} -->
