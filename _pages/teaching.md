I teach this course for mechanical engineering master's students. The aim of the course is to teach the various aspects of machine tool design from structural design of the frame to the choice of linear guides all the way to their control architechtures.

I also give courses on the fundamentals of 3D printing, milling and laser cutting in makerspaces and fablabs. I have offered these courses for engineers as well as for school children.

I also offer build workshops whereby participants build a 3D printer from a lego like instruction manual over 2 days. I prepare the kit at home and get it all to the event location on build day. At the end of the 2 day build workshop, the participants have built a 3d printer from scratch.
