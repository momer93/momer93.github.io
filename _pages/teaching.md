### Fertigungstechnik (Manufacturing Technology 1 & 2) 

Indepth 2 part course on the fundamentals of manufacturing technologies for bachelor students of mechanical engineering. The topics covered are: Forming, Machining, Casting, Additive Manufacturing, Manufacturing cost analysis etc.

### Fertigungssysteme Werkzeugmaschinen (Manufacturing Machine Tools)

Advanced course for mechanical engineering master's students. The aim of the course is to teach the various aspects of machine tool design from structural design of the frame to the choice of linear guides all the way to their control architectures.

### Digital Fabrication

I also give courses on the fundamentals of 3D printing, milling and laser cutting in makerspaces and fablabs. I have offered these courses for engineers as well as for school children.

### 3D printer build workshops

2 day build workshops whereby a group of 4-6 participants build a 3D printer from a lego like instruction manual. I prepare the kit at home and get it all to the event location on build day. At the end of the 2 day build workshop, the participants have built a fully functional 3d printer from scratch.

### Digital Fabrication for Children

I offered hands on courses on fun topics of 3d printing, CAD design, laser cutting, electronics and robotics on the weekends for children ages 8-16.
