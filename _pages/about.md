Hi, I am Mohammed and I come from Oman, a quiet and peaceful country in the middle east. I started an apprenticeship in a steel fabrication facility when I was 16 and then studied mechanical engineering since how things were made fascinated me so much. In my bachelor thesis I designed and manufactured a completely carbon fibre composite monocoque structure for the shell eco marathon vehicle. In my master's thesis I analysed and optimized a rapid hot forging process for an automotive tier 1 supplier while also designing conformal cooling channels for the forging die. After graduation i worked at Airbus where I made assembly instruciton manuals for the hydraulic, mechanical and electrical assembly in the final assembly line for commercial Airbus aircraft like the A350,A320 neo and the A380. Next i joined the Federal Armed Forces University in Hamburg, where I am currently researching open source machine tools. During my stints in the construction, automotive and aerospace industries, I worked in various roles such as R&D, quantity surveying, manufacturing process simulation, project management, cost estimation and managing people.
 
Growing up as an immigrant in Oman, I have witnessed first hand the hardships and challenges faced by migrants in setting up and running their own manufacturing businesses. Seeing their inability to come out of the vicious cycle of poverty and stunted growth, led me to think of ways i could use engineering to create an impact. In my PhD, I propose that these micro-entrepreneuers could build their own production resources (machine tools) if the design blueprints and build instructions were made open source and freely accessible on the internet. To that effect, i explore this hypothesis through an empirical (engineering proof of concept machine prototypes using frugal design) and qualitative methods (interviews, observations and surveys).

<!--So my tentative thesis title is 'Exploring the potential of open source machine tools (OSMT) for the sustainable and cost-effective development of microenterprises in resource constrained settings'. Open source machine tools or OSMT was not an academic term until we coined it in our first conference paper at the CPSL in Vancouver in early 2022. OSMT are machine tools whose blueprints are made freely available on the internet for anyone to access, use, modify, replicate or even sell the machines produced using the designs.My research revolves around investigating how machine tools can be designed for low resource contexts and what challenges and barriers would affect their adoption and diffusion. I use resource constrained migrant run manufacturing micro-enterprises (ME) in Oman as a case study for my work. 

To that effect, I intend to design 4 open source machine tools namely a CNC gas cutter, a CNC milling router, a semi automated large diameter pipe bending machine and a 3D printer. These technologies are not the bleeding edge of technologies but rather outdated in industrialized countries. Moreover, considering how everyone is already talking about the 5th and 6th industrial revolutions, while many manufacturing microenterprises in developing and least developing countries are still using labour intensive and inefficient analog machine tools. Their access to more modern technologies is limited by their limited resources, research capabilities, literacy levels etc.Therefore the divide between the industrialized economies and developing economies is widening and as a result wealth distribution is becoming more and more distorted. 

My work is interdisciplinary since my topic is a socio-technical one. So even though i do work on the engineering design of machines, I do it by keeping the social context of the end user in mind. I do this by carrying out field work that involves qualitative interviews, field observations and focus groups.

Our group brings together people from different disciplines such as engineering, social sciences, geography, economics and law. The crux of our research is really exploring the nexus between open source hardware (OSH) and society.  -->
