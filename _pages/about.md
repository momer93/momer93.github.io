Hello, I'm Mohammed, and I call Oman, a peaceful country in the Middle East, my home. My journey into engineering commenced with an apprenticeship in a steel fabrication facility at the age of 16. It was there that I found a deep-rooted fascination for understanding the mechanics of manufacturing things. This intrigue led me to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. In my undergraduate thesis, I designed and manufactured a completely carbon fibre composite monocoque structure for the shell eco marathon competition vehicle. Later, during my master's studies, I focused on optimizing rapid hot forging processes for a key automotive supplier while also delving into the intricacies of designing conformal cooling channels for forging dies.

My professional journey has been shaped by diverse experiences from crafting assembly manuals for Airbus commercial aircraft to my current pursuit of designing frugal open-source machine tools at the Federal Armed Forces University in Hamburg. During my time in the construction, automotive, and aerospace sectors, I've had the chance to experience various roles, including R&D, project management, and  leadership. Each step has been a humbling opportunity to learn, adapt, and contribute.

My current research is deeply rooted in my upbringing as an immigrant in Oman. Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the struggles and hurdles faced by migrants striving to establish and sustain their micro-manufacturing enterprises. Their enduring challenges in breaking free from the cycle of poverty and limited growth sparked a contemplation on how engineering could drive positive change.

In my PhD i propose the idea: Empower these micro-entrepreneurs by providing them access to design blueprints and assembly instructions for building their own production resources, specifically CNC or automated machine tools. My belief is that by making these resources open-source and freely available on the internet, it could pave the way for transformational opportunities. To substantiate this hypothesis, my research follows a dual approach. On one hand, I delve into an empirical exploration, developing proof-of-concept machine prototypes using frugal design principles. Concurrently, I employ qualitative methodologies such as interviews, observations, and surveys to gain deeper insights into the practical implications and potential impact of this approach along with pitfalls and challenges.

I aim to connect engineering with meaningful social change by making knowledge accessible. My focus is on empowering individuals in marginalized communities by providing them with the tools and resources they need. It's about using innovation and inclusivity to create real, positive change.

Apart from work and research, which I am doing really most of the time since I am so passionate about it :P I actually watch anime to wind down and also love building stuff like 3d printed nerf guns, RC cars or just whatever new project I can think of. I enjoy fixing stuff that breaks, and also extract parts from junk which I know i could use for other projects. I also like reading fiction and biographical novels, Steve Job's biography is my all time favourite. My favourite fiction authors are J.K. Rowling, Khaled Husseini, Allistair Mclean and quite a few others.  

<!--So my tentative thesis title is 'Exploring the potential of open source machine tools (OSMT) for the sustainable and cost-effective development of microenterprises in resource constrained settings'. Open source machine tools or OSMT was not an academic term until we coined it in our first conference paper at the CPSL in Vancouver in early 2022. OSMT are machine tools whose blueprints are made freely available on the internet for anyone to access, use, modify, replicate or even sell the machines produced using the designs.My research revolves around investigating how machine tools can be designed for low resource contexts and what challenges and barriers would affect their adoption and diffusion. I use resource constrained migrant run manufacturing micro-enterprises (ME) in Oman as a case study for my work. 

To that effect, I intend to design 4 open source machine tools namely a CNC gas cutter, a CNC milling router, a semi automated large diameter pipe bending machine and a 3D printer. These technologies are not the bleeding edge of technologies but rather outdated in industrialized countries. Moreover, considering how everyone is already talking about the 5th and 6th industrial revolutions, while many manufacturing microenterprises in developing and least developing countries are still using labour intensive and inefficient analog machine tools. Their access to more modern technologies is limited by their limited resources, research capabilities, literacy levels etc.Therefore the divide between the industrialized economies and developing economies is widening and as a result wealth distribution is becoming more and more distorted. 

My work is interdisciplinary since my topic is a socio-technical one. So even though i do work on the engineering design of machines, I do it by keeping the social context of the end user in mind. I do this by carrying out field work that involves qualitative interviews, field observations and focus groups.

Our group brings together people from different disciplines such as engineering, social sciences, geography, economics and law. The crux of our research is really exploring the nexus between open source hardware (OSH) and society.  -->
