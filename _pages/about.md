I am a PhD student at the Federal Armed Forces University in Hamburg, Germany. My background is in mechanical engineering with a focus on manufacuring technologies. My research is focused on the frugal design of machine tools for low resource settings.

My work is interdisciplinary since my topic is a socio-technical one. So even though i do work on the engineering design of machines, I do it by keeping the social context of the end user in mind. I do this by carrying out field work that involves qualitative interviews, field observations and focus groups.
