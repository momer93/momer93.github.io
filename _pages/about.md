Hi, I am Mohammed and I am originally from Bangladesh but was born and brought up in Oman, and now live and study in Germany. I am one of those people who never really belong anywhere, I have been an immigrant from the day I was born, so I innately know the hardships and challenges faced by migrants in becoming entreprenuers. 

I studied mechanical engineering and also gained interesting experiences in the construction, automotive and aerospace industries. In early 2021 I was fortunate to get a PhD position in the new production institute at the Federal Armed Forces University in Hamburg.

Our group brings together people from different disciplines such as engineering, social sciences, geogrpahy, economics and law. The crux of our research is really exploring the nexus between open source hardware (OSH) and soceity. My work focuses on exploring the potential of open source machine tools (OSMT) for the sustaimnable and cost-effective development of microenterprises in resource constrained settings. Open source machine tools or OSMT was not an academic term untill we coined it in our first conference paper at the CPSL in Vancouver in early 2022. OSMT are machine tools whose blueprints are made freely available on the internet for anyone to access, use, modify, replicate or even sell the machines produced using the designs.

My work revolves around investigating how machine tools can be designed for low resource contexts and what challenges and barriers would affect their adoption and diffusion. I use resource constrained migrant run manufacturing microenterprises (ME) in Oman as a case study for my work. Such MEs are truly 

To that effect, I intend to design 4 open source machine tools namely a CNC gas cutter, a CNC milling router, a semi automated large diameter pipe bending machine and a 3D printer. These technolgies are ofcourse very basic and relatively outdated, considering how everyone is already talking about the 5th and 6th industrial revolutions. However, many manufacturing microenterprises in developing and least developing countries are still using labour intensive and inefficient analog machine tools. Their access to more modern technologies is limited by their limited resources, research capabilities, literacy levels etc.Therefore the divide between the industrialized economies and developing economies is widening and as a result wealth distribution is becoming more and more distorted. 

My work is interdisciplinary since my topic is a socio-technical one. So even though i do work on the engineering design of machines, I do it by keeping the social context of the end user in mind. I do this by carrying out field work that involves qualitative interviews, field observations and focus groups.
