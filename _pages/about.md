Hi, I am Mohammed and I am originally from Bangladesh but was born and brought up in Oman. I studied mechanical engineering and also worked a little in the construciton, automotive and aerospace industries. In early 2021 I was fortunate to get a PhD position in a group that was researching open source hardware (OSH) at the Federal Armed Forces University in Hamburg.

This was a dream come true for me, since I knew OSH could be used for so much real world impact. However, working full time after my masters did not give me the time to explore my interests. My work focuses on exploring the potential of open source machine tools (OSMT) for the sustaimnable and cost-effective development of microenterprises in resource constrained settings. In other words I want to investigate how machine tools can be designed for low resource contexts and what challenges and barriers would affect their adoption and diffusion.

To that effect, I intend to design 4 open source machine tools namely a CNC gas cutter, a CNC milling router, a semi automated large diameter pipe bending machine and a 3D printer. These technolgies are ofcourse very basic and relatively outdated, considering how everyone is already talking about the 5th and 6th industrial revolutions. However, many manufacturing microenterprises in developing and least developing countries are still using labour intensive and inefficient analog machine tools. Their access to more modern technologies is limited by their limited resources, research capabilities, literacy levels etc.Therefore the divide between the industrialized economies and developing economies is widening and as a result wealth distribution is becoming more and more distorted. 

My work is interdisciplinary since my topic is a socio-technical one. So even though i do work on the engineering design of machines, I do it by keeping the social context of the end user in mind. I do this by carrying out field work that involves qualitative interviews, field observations and focus groups.
