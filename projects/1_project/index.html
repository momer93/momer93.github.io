The aim of the design is to automate the hand held oxyfuel cutter as seen in figure below. The machine was designed to be as affordable as possible while being reliable enough to function in the harsh environments seen in Oman. The design is focused on being ultra affordable while being able to be built from the local resouces available to the microenterprises. Therefore this isn’t a design for everyone but really tailored to be reproduced in Oman with simple tools and components. The machine frame is made from standard square steel profiles which are locally available. The Motors, belt drive components and electronics are typical 3d printer components and were chosen due to their affordability and availability.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GC1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Working Gas Cutter" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Working proof of concept of the CNC Oxyfuel Cutter </div> <p>The project was started by carrying our a field visit to manufacturing microenterprises in the industrial cluster of Wadi Kabir Sanaya in the city of Muscat. The cluster has a pre-dominantly dense population of migrant run manufacturing microenterprises. Due to limited online and telecommunication opportunities of the microenterprises, interviews with the respondents were carried out face to face at their sites of business. The respondents were all male migrants from the South Asian countries of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. Talking with the shop owners revealed insights into their available resources, educational backgrounds and day to day lives. Most had small workshop spaces which were not more than 15-20 square meters. They were all open air workshops with no climate control and dust being everywhere. When asked about the need for more automated machines, they often complained about the lack of space because they imagined CNC or automated machine tools must be really big as industrial machines normally are. Most small shops had 2-3 workers and none of the workshops observed had any CNC machine tools. Those that did possess machine tools, these were usually manual lathes that were often purchased used. None of them carried out precision work, so they usually produced structural (car park shades, warehouses etc) and non structural items (gates, staircases, railings, furniture etc.) None of them had access to CNC machine tools and had no idea about CAD or CAM.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GC2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Interviews" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GC3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Interviews" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC4-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC4-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GC4-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GC4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Interviews" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Interviewing owners and workers from various steel fabrication microenterprises in Oman. </div> <p>As a next step various manufacturing processes within such workshops were observed to determine possible processes that could be automated. Gas cutting was chosen due to its potential for increased efficiency and productivity for the users. From the interviews it was revealed that due to the lack of space, users would prefer something that could be easily stowed away when not needed and most importantly they needed their the machine to be as cheap as possible. Many estimated that they would be able to afford the machine if it were to cost between 500 and 800 USD. Bigger shops that had more employees and access to bigger jobs had a higher budget of about 1500-2000 USD.Next functional requirements were derived depending on the surveyed local resources from local shops such as available raw materials and other mechanical and electronic components.

Most firms in developing countries are still using analog technologies and have not attained the industrial maturity required to harness the benefits of industry 4.0, which include increased productivity and a reduced environmental impact of the manufacturing sector. This further exacerbates the unequal wealth distribution pervasive in today’s globalized world. With the democratization of the internet and increasing accessibility to microcontrollers and automation technology, the last decade has seen the rise of open source machine tools (OSMT) such as CNC mills and 3D printers. By facilitating sustainable and inclusive production capacity building, OSMT are a key technology driver that can enable developing countries to leapfrog their industries. However, their potential for cost effective and low-threshold production capacity building in developing countries has been hitherto underexplored. This paper reports the findings of a pilot study in Oman with ten migrant-run microenterprises in the carpentry and steel fabrication industries. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. The study identifies and discusses the challenges that could hinder the implementation of OSMT in a resource constrained context, which include insufficient technological and digital literacy, a lack of formal education, and risk adversity. Based on this, the paper proposes solutions to foster OSMT adoption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Omer2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Pushing the Frontiers of Personal Manufacturing with Open Source Machine Tools</div> <div class="author"> M.

Today individuals can design and manufacture a variety of products in their living rooms. However, scaling a product from prototype to production and setting up a small-scale manufacturing business is often hindered by the expensive machinery and high upfront capital investment required. This paper presents the findings of a unique experiment that was carried out to understand the process of prototyping a relatively complex product (in this case, a 3D printer) in a home setting and then scaling it up to a small-scale production (10 units). In order to partially automate the manufacturing processes, two open source machine tools (OSMT), whose blueprints are freely available in the internet, were built, namely a CNC laser cutter and a CNC milling machine. The experiment reveals the particularities of starting a small-scale production in a home setting and the potential of OSMT to affordably scale up production, while also highlighting the challenges of OSMT adoption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="https://doi.org/10.15488/12154" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Democratizing Manufacturing – Conceptualizing the Potential of Open Source Machine Tools as Drivers of Sustainable Industrial Development in Resource Constrained Contexts</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Omer, Melina Kaiser, Manuel Moritz, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

While machine tools are a subset of OSHW, they have received relatively little academic attention compared to electronic OSHW. This study applies an explorative research approach and analyses open source designs for machine tools freely available on the internet. By coining, the term open source machine tools (OSMT), it determines their applicability in low resource contexts and identifies the potential of OSMTs in democratizing manufacturing technologies. OSMTs thereby encourage diversification, entrepreneurship, and inclusive industrial development, thus contributing to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal no. 8 which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

One special form of OSH are machine tools, which are developed in an open-source manner, so called Open Source Machine Tools (OSMTs). OSMTs enable the manufacturing of hardware artefacts within open labs, fab labs and open production networks. Additionally, the distributed design and development as well as the replication process of OSMTs are aimed on increasing the technological literacy of its users within a community. The research presented in this paper focusses on the replication process of OSMTs within community-based workshops in the field of Fab City Hamburg. The current state of replication processes of already developed and prototyped OSMTs has been outlined based on interviews, observations and document analyses. First insights were gained whilst participating in community-based workshops as well as through conversations with the workshop participants and instructors along with OSMT designers and engineers. Subsequently the replication process of OSMTs was analysed and areas of improvement have been detected with regards to enhancing the technological literacy of the workshop participants. The authors conclude that OSH build workshops bare great potential of a new, holistic approach to achieving technological literacy within a short period of time. With this paper, the authors identify important interconnections of OSMT replicability and technological literacy through replication workshops and form a basis for further research within this area.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="https://doi.org/10.13140/rg.2.2.31018.80320" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Design and Analysis of a Composite Chassis for Shell Eco Marathon Prototype Vehicle 2016 using Finite Element Analysis</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Omer</div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The aim of this thesis is to design and analyse an optimal lightweight chassis for the GUtech Shell Eco Marathon Team (GSET) prototype vehicle 2016. Considering the fact that increased weight has a detrimental effect on fuel economy, this thesis aims to aid the weight reduction objective set by GSET through designing a chassis that is lighter and stiffer than the previous year’s chassis. The overall proportions of the vehicle are also reduced by packaging the rear end in a more compact manner. Chassis design concepts are introduced and different composite materials are analysed. The newly designed composite chassis is modelled in Solidworks and then simulated in ANSYS Workbench Mechanical coupled with ANSYS Composite PrepPost using finite element analysis (FEA). Several possible loading scenarios are taken into consideration and then simulated in order to achieve the optimum compromise between low weight and adequate stiffness. A sandwich panel structure utilising nomex and carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) is researched instead of a solely carbon fibre approach. The effect of increasing the sandwich core thickness is analysed using FEA. Furthermore an attempt to implement the engine as a chassis member is looked at with the final composite chassis design weighing in at less than half as much as the previous year’s aluminium chassis. A 55% weight reduction is achieved without compromising on stiffness and in the final chapter fabrication recommendations are provided that would be helpful for the next generation of GSET to fabricate the composite chassis in the University workshop.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Mohammed Omer.
