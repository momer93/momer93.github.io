The aim of the design is to automate the hand held oxyfuel cutter as seen in figure below. The machine was designed to be as affordable as possible while being reliable enough to function in the harsh environments seen in Oman. The design is focused on being ultra affordable while being able to be built from the local resouces available to the microenterprises. Therefore this isn’t a design for everyone but really tailored to be reproduced in Oman with simple tools and components. The machine frame is made from standard square steel profiles which are locally available. The Motors, belt drive components and electronics are typical 3d printer components and were chosen due to their affordability and availability.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gc1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="CNC gas cutter model" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> CAD design of the CNC Oxyfuel Cutter </div> <p>The project was started by carrying our a field visit to manufacturing microenterprises in the industrial cluster of Wadi Kabir Sanaya in the city of Muscat. The cluster has a pre-dominantly dense population of migrant run manufacturing microenterprises. Due to limited online and telecommunication opportunities of the microenterprises, interviews with the respondents were carried out face to face at their sites of business. The respondents were all male migrants from the South Asian countries of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. Talking with the shop owners revealed insights into their available resources, educational backgrounds and day to day lives. Most had small workshop spaces which were not more than 15-20 square meters. They were all open air workshops with no climate control and dust being everywhere. When asked about the need for more automated machines, they often complained about the lack of space because they imagined CNC or automated machine tools must be really big as industrial machines normally are. Most small shops had 2-3 workers and none of the workshops observed had any CNC machine tools. Those that did possess machine tools, these were usually manual lathes that were often purchased used. None of them carried out precision work, so they usually produced structural (car park shades, warehouses etc) and non structural items (gates, staircases, railings, furniture etc.) None of them had access to CNC machine tools and had no idea about CAD or CAM.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gc2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Interviews_1" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gc3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Interviews_2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc4-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc4-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc4-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gc4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Interviews_2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Interviewing owners and workers from various steel fabrication microenterprises in Oman. </div> <p>As a next step various manufacturing processes within such workshops were observed to determine possible processes that could be automated. Gas cutting was chosen due to its potential for increased efficiency and productivity for the users. From the interviews it was revealed that due to the lack of space, users would prefer something that could be easily stowed away when not needed and most importantly they needed their the machine to be as cheap as possible. Many estimated that they would be able to afford the machine if it were to cost between 500 and 800 USD. Bigger shops that had more employees and access to bigger jobs had a higher budget of about 1500-2000 USD.Next functional requirements were derived depending on the surveyed local resources from local shops such as available raw materials and other mechanical and electronic components.</p> <p>The biggest constraints for this project were the materials and components availability. Starting with the frame, the cheapest materials available was mild steel hollow sections, rolled profiles and plates. Aluminum was almost impossible to find. There were no online platforms or shops that listed Oman doesn’t really have marketplaces for hobby components like electronics, motors or other components required for machine building. Online stores do exist but they are mainly selling consumer appliances. This means it is almost impossible to find parts for building smaller machines such as M3 and smaller screws or other standard machine elements. There are new stores coming up to cater to the needs of spare parts for chinese machine tools that many are importing from China. However, these are more for industrial scale machines. The only way was to visit several local shops and make a list of commonly available materials. I listed these on an excel sheet along with their prices. This list constrained my available materials for use in the design. Next on discussions with the workshop workers and owner, we found there were a select few profiles, plates or bars that were often in surplus in the workshops since they used these often for fabrication jobs. They would prefer to use these than to have to buy one off exotic profiles. These field searches and discussions with the end user helped inform the choice of materials and parts for the design.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc10-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc10-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc10-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gc10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Materials list" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Snapshot of the materials excel sheet </div> <p>The design started with paper sketches, internet searches and some rough calculations on paper before progressing onto CAD. The linear guides were the defining machine element that decided the final machine design since most conventional linear bearings such as linear rails, profile linear guides, rack and pinion etc were not locally available. These would also be expensive to source on international B2C ecommerce platforms like aliexpress due to the excessive shipping costs owing to their weight. There were some local shops selling linear profile guides but these were for larger industrial machines and were far too expensive to stay within the budget requirements. Therefore a simple linear bearing concept made of radial roller bearings mounted on bolts as axles was used for the X and Y cartesian motion. The bearing setup can be preloaded by simply tightening the bolts and this way can also account for profiles with varying dimensional tolerances.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc5-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc5-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/gc5-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gc5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Linear carriage model" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Cad model of the linear carriage design </div> <p>The Z axis setup was the most complex part of the machine since a typical manual gas cutter torch had to be mounted and the lever actuated.

Most firms in developing countries are still using analog technologies and have not attained the industrial maturity required to harness the benefits of industry 4.0, which include increased productivity and a reduced environmental impact of the manufacturing sector. This further exacerbates the unequal wealth distribution pervasive in today’s globalized world. With the democratization of the internet and increasing accessibility to microcontrollers and automation technology, the last decade has seen the rise of open source machine tools (OSMT) such as CNC mills and 3D printers. By facilitating sustainable and inclusive production capacity building, OSMT are a key technology driver that can enable developing countries to leapfrog their industries. However, their potential for cost effective and low-threshold production capacity building in developing countries has been hitherto underexplored. This paper reports the findings of a pilot study in Oman with ten migrant-run microenterprises in the carpentry and steel fabrication industries. Semi-structured interviews and field observations were carried out to gain an understanding of the technology needs and readiness levels of the target group. The study identifies and discusses the challenges that could hinder the implementation of OSMT in a resource constrained context, which include insufficient technological and digital literacy, a lack of formal education, and risk adversity. Based on this, the paper proposes solutions to foster OSMT adoption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/pp4-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/pp4-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/pp4-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/pp4.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="auto" height="auto" alt="pp4.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="https://doi.org/10.15488/12154" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Democratizing Manufacturing – Conceptualizing the Potential of Open Source Machine Tools as Drivers of Sustainable Industrial Development in Resource Constrained Contexts</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Omer, Melina Kaiser, Manuel Moritz, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

While machine tools are a subset of OSHW, they have received relatively little academic attention compared to electronic OSHW. This study applies an explorative research approach and analyses open source designs for machine tools freely available on the internet. By coining, the term open source machine tools (OSMT), it determines their applicability in low resource contexts and identifies the potential of OSMTs in democratizing manufacturing technologies. OSMTs thereby encourage diversification, entrepreneurship, and inclusive industrial development, thus contributing to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal no. 8 which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Specific areas for OSMT application in low-resource contexts and factors and barriers affecting their success are singled out.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Mohammed Omer.
